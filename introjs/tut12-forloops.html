        <h1>For Loops: Iteration using a FOR Loop</h1>

        <p>A 'for' loop in JavaScript appears as it does in C language for the most part. You can 
        declare a var within a for loop, or you can create it at the top of the function in 
        which the loop exists (or globally if desired, though global scope must be dealt with 
        using caution, as with any other language).</p>

        <p>A 'for' loop looks as follows: </p>

        <p>for (initializer; condition; counter) {}<p>

        <ul type="square">
            <li>initializer: declared variable to hold starting number, to be used in the loop</li>
            <li>condition: this MUST be an expression that returns true or false. It can be 
                read as "Keep looping as long as this condition is true."</li>
            <li>counter: this is how we change the variables initialized (either by increasing
                or decreasing them). Commonly, we increment variables by 1 using the ++ 
                operator and decrement by 1 using --.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>As long as the condition is true, the code inside the curly braces will run. After 
        running, the counter expression will run, and then the condition will be checked again.</p>

        <p>On this page, you will enter a starting number and an ending number. The simple goal 
        of the combined JavaScript program will be to iterate from the first to the last, 
        printing them on the page immediately after the "Do It!" button on a single line. 
        Basic, but it certainly will illustrate how to use a for loop if you take a look at 
        the <a href="js/tut12-forloops.js" target="_blank">actual JavaScript code</a> in the 
        'js' folder accompanying this HTML document.</p>

        <form name="form" id="userSuppliedNums" method="post" action="">

            <p>
            <label for "firstNum">Enter starting number: <label>
                <input name="firstNum" id="firstNum" type="text"> 
            <label for "lastNum">Enter ending number: </label>
                <input name="lastNum" id="lastNum" type="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                <button type="button" onclick="main();">Do It!</button>
            </p>
        
        </form>

        <p>OUTPUT:</p>
        <p id="p1"></p>
