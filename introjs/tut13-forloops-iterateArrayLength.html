        <h1>Using 'for' Loops to Iterate Entire Length of an Array</h1>

        <p>We can combine the 'length' method and a 'for' loop to know exactly how many 
        iterations we will have to make to go from the beginning element to the ending 
        element of an array. We will do that here. Built into the 
        <a href="js/tut13-forloops-iterateArrayLength.js" target="_blank">JavaScript program </a>
        accompanying this HTML page is an array pre-populated with some of my favorite 
        food types. We will look at how many food types there are (elements in the array), 
        set a counter to that number, and them display them to the screen when clicking 
        the button. Short but sweet. </p>

        <p>Go ahead and run the program by clicking the button. Then, load up the JavaScript 
        program in your favorite text editor and change the food types for your own liking. 
        If you enter fewer choices (or even additional items) in the myFavFoods array, you 
        will notice that the program automatically accomodates those changes without 
        the need to tell the program how many items are in the array. Which IS the meaning 
        behind what this example aims to demonstrate :)</p>

        <form name="startProgram" id="startProgram" method="post" action="">

            <p>Click to start program and display results below: 
            <button type="button" onclick="main();">Do It!</button>
            </p>

        </form>

        <p>Output:</p>

        <p id="p1"></p>
