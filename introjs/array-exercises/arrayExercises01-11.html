        <h1>Array Exercises: Rithm School's Array Exercises 1 To 11</h1>

        <p>Below will be printed the results of the javascript file after it has run through 
        all of the exercises. I have opted to do all of the exercises in one html file and 
        one JavaScript file, rather than in separate files. To see any comments and notes 
        I may have added, please see the <a href="js/arrayExercises01-11.js" target="_blank">
        actual JavaScript file</a> for more details on what I did in the course of entering 
        my answers to the exercise questions. </p>

        <p>The exercises are as follows:</p>

        <p>Beginning array: var people = ["Greg", "Mary", "Devon", "James"];</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Using a loop, iterate through the above array and console.log all of the 
            people (I have opted to sent the output to the bottom of this page).</li>
            <li>Write the command to remove "Greg" from the array.</li>
            <li>Write the command to remove "James" from the array.</li>
            <li>Write the command to add "Matt" to the front of the array.</li>
            <li>Write the command to add your name to the end of the array.</li>
            <li>Using a loop, iterate through this array and after console-log-ing "Mary", 
            exit from the loop.</li>
            <li>Write the command to make a copy of the array using 'slice'. The copy should 
            NOT include "Mary" or "Matt".</li>
            <li>Write the command that gives the indexOf where "Mary" is located.</li>
            <li>Write the command that gives the indexOf where "Foo" is located (this should 
            return -1).</li>
            <li>Redefine the people variable with the value you started with. Using the 
            'splice' command, remove "Devon" from the array and add "Elizabeth" and 
            "Artie". Your array should look like this when you are done: 
            ["Greg", "Mary", "Elizabeth", "Artie", "James"].</li>
            <li>Create a new variable called 'withBob' and set it equal to the 'people' array 
            concatenated with the string of "Bob".</li>

        <p>OUTPUT:</p>
