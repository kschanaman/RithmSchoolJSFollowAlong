        <h1>Using Switch Statements to Test For Conditions</h1>

        <p>So far, we've looked at if, if-else, and if-else-if statements in the code we have 
        been using. However, sometimes there may be just a simple set of cases that need 
        lightweight checking for things, and some limited output based on each. In such 
        cases, a 'switch' statement can be used, though switch statements are used less 
        frequently than other control and flow methods. </p>

        <p>Enter how you're feeling today: happy, sad, hungry, or something else if desired. 
        The output at the bottom of the screen will appear based on your entry. </p>

        <p>Be sure to check out the <a href="js/tut07-switchstatements.js" target="_blank">
        actual javascript code</a> found in the 'js' directory accompanying this set of exercises
        to see the additional comments I placed within it for those who are also just 
        learning this technology.</p>

        <form name="form" id="form" method="post" action="">

            <p><label for = "emotionalState">What is your status:</label></p>
            <p><input name="emotionalState" id="emotionalState" type="text"></p>

            <!-- I was having a dickens of a time with the submit button on the next line. 
            The output to the p element at the end (id="p1") would flicker, disappearing 
            rapidly after clicking it. I was using button type="submit" rather than 
            button type="button" which was causing the page to refresh. The page will 
            auto-submit, clearing what was output. Use type "button" when trying to 
            submit things in the way I am here in these examples. -->

            <p><button type="button" onclick="emotionTracker();">Confide In Me</button></p>

        </form>

        <p>Output:</p>

        <p id="p1"></p>
