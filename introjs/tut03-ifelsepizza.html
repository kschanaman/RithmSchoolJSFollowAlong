    <h1>Using if-else in JavaScript For Program Flow</h1>

    <p>This simple page uses a javascript file named tut03-ifelsepizza.js to determine whether or 
    not the user shares in the same food tastes as the program does. The program loves pizza. 
    If the user shares in the same favorite food (pizza) then the program issues a 'me too' 
    response.</p>

    <p>If the user likes something else other than pizza, it's still cool with the program. But 
    it will boast that it likes pizza and doesn't share in the user's taste in cuisine :D</p>

    <p>Be sure to have a look at <a href="js/tut03-ifelsepizza.js" target="_blank">
    the actual JavaScript file in the 'js' directory</a> to see the comments I placed 
    within it for further explanation of the following code. The code for this little 
    exercise looks as follows:</p>
    
    <pre>

        window.onload = function main() {
            
            var favoriteFood = prompt("What's your favorite food?");
            
            pId = document.getElementById("p1");
           
            if (favoriteFood === "pizza" || favoriteFood === "Pizza") {
                pId.innerHTML="Whoah! My favorite food is pizza too!");
            } else {
                pId.innerHTML="That's cool. My favorite food is pizza.");
            }
        
        }

    </pre>

    <p>And now here is the output on what you entered into the prompt at the outset:</p>

    <p id="p1"></p>
