        <h1>Using 'while' Loops in JavaScript</h1>

        <p>While loops are similar to for loops, with the exception that you must manually 
        add an increment or decrement statement within the loop, and your counter must 
        be initialized before being used in that while loop.</p>

        <p>In this page, you will be asked for two numbers which will be added together. 
        A while loop will check to make sure you entered a number. As long as the input 
        of either entry is NOT a number, the while loop will print an error message to this 
        HTML page telling you one of the entries wasn't a valid number.  Once you've entered 
        two actual numbers, the while loop will break out and have the program do the 
        addition and output for you.</p>

        <p>Be sure to check out the <a href="js/tut14-whileloops.js" target="_blank">
        actual Javascript program file</a> that accompanies this page for details about how it 
        works, as I have commented the code to that end.</p>

        <form name="form" id="getTwoNums" method="post" action="">

        <label for "getFirstNum">Enter first number: </label>
            <input name="getFirstNum" id="getFirstNum" type="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <label for "getSecondNum">Enter second number: </label>
            <input name="getSecondNum" id="getSecondNum" type="text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;
        <button type="button" onclick="main();">Add Numbers</button>

        </form>

        <p>Output: </p>
