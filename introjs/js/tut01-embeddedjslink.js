    This is the very first javascript program in the tutorials. A simple little alert box 
    will pop up on the screen informing that we've successfully learned how to embed a 
    script link inside of an HTML file called 'tut01-embeddedjslink.html.  This javascript 
    file will be similarly named to avoid confusion: 'tut01-embeddedjslink.js' and will be 
    stored in the js folder along with all future others.

    // Provide an alert() box
    alert("Coming to you from tut01-embeddedjslink.js!");

// End of javascript program
