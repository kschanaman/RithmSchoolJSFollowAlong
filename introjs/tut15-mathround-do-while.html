        <h1>Interation of an Array Using 'do-while'</h1>

        <p>The do-while loop in JavaScript is similar to a while loop with the exception that 
        it is guaranteed to run a section of code at least once all the way through before 
        checking to see if a condition is true. </p>

        <p>Here on this example, there will be an array of decimal point numbers built into 
        an array (found in the <a href="js/tut15-mathround-do-while.js" target="_blank">
        actual JavaScript code</a> accompanying this page in the 'js' directory). A do-while 
        loop will go through the list of elements in the array, applying Math.round to each 
        so they are rounded up.  The output will be displayed at the bottom of this page 
        with no user interaction this time, in this exercise.  Please have a look at the 
        JavaScript code, as there will be comments made within it.</p>

        <p>Our built-in array looks like this: <br>
        floatArray = [1.1, 2.1, 1.6, 3.1, 1.8, 2.9, 5.5, 3.14, 7.62, 39.7]</p>

        <p>JavaScript now provides its output to you below once the page is completely 
        loaded:</p>
