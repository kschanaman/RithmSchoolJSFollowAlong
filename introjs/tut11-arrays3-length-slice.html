        <h1>Arrays3: Playing With Length and Slice in Arrays</h1>

        <p>We can use the length property (it isn't a function) to determine how many elements
        exist in an array. This can be handy when we come to the point where we need to know 
        the maximum number of iterations to make covering an entire array via a loop, so we 
        don't exceed that number. If we exceed the number of elements in an array, we will 
        get 'undefined' results for all non-existent elements.</p>

        <p>The slice() function, used by itself, will make a copy of an entire array. This 
        is placed into a new variable for future use.  But slice also takes two arguments 
        much like splice() covered in the last example (<a href="tut10-arrays2-splice.html" target="_blank">
        tut10-arrays2-splice.html</a>). The first number is the first element where you want to 
        begin slicing. The second number is the last element where you want to stop slicing 
        (but that last element is NOT INCLUDED IN the slice - key point to remember!!). </p>

        <p>In this page, below, you can create an array, add some items to it, look at the 
        number of elements being displayed as you do (will appear under the array line), 
        remove elements, create a new array using slice() to copy the first one, and to then 
        be able to slice out sections from that copied array to then create a third array 
        containing the sliced data. Be sure to check out the <a href="js/tut11-arrays3-length-slice.js">
        actual JavaScript file</a> in the 'js' directory accompanying this page.</p>

        <p>Your first created array: <span id="firstUserArrName"></span> = [<span id="firstArray"></span>]<br>
        This array contains <span id="firstArrLen"></span> elements.</p>

        <form name="nameFirstArr" id="nameFirstArr" method="post" action="">
            <p>
             <label for="getFirstArrName">Enter a name for your first array (one word, no spaces): </label>
             <input name="getFirstArrName" id="getFirstArrName" type="text"></p>
            <p>
             <label for="addFirstArrEl">Add elements one at a time now (click button below after each): </label>
             <input name="addFirstArrEl" id="addFirstArrEl" type="text"></p>
            <p>
            Below is a copy of the array (firstArray) you have been working on. The copy 
            was made using slice() and was added to a different variable (Look at the 
            JavaScript code file accompanying this HTML page to see how it's used).
            </p>
            <p id="displaySecondArrInfo"></p>
            <p>
            You can modify the copy without affecting the original. Just put a checkmark 
            next to the selection below to pop() (remove) the last element for proof.
            </p>
            <p>
            <input name="popOff" id="popOff" type="checkbox"> Pop the last element from the array</p>
            <p>
            <button type="button" onclick="main();">Create First Array</button></p>

        </form>
