        <h1>JavaScript Objects: Creating Objects, Adding to Objects, Deleting Items</h1>

        <p>Rithm School's first exercises with objects asks that the student create an object 
        that has his/her first name, last name, and occupation as keys. The student then 
        practices accessing each of the values from the object using both dot notation and 
        bracket notation. </p>

        <p>After this has been accomplished, add a key for 'hobby' to the object, while 
        removing the key and value for 'occupation'. </p>

        <p>There will be no user interactivity here on this page, but the JavaScript will 
        print its own results down below.  To see how it brought forth the output it does, 
        please be sure to see the <a href="js/tut16-javascriptObjects.js">actual JavaScript 
        code</a> included in 'js' directory that resides along with this HTML page. I include 
        ample quantities of comments in the code explaining what I did and how the code is 
        behaving.</p>
