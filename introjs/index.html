    Here in the Rithm School folder of the 'learn' directory, I will be following along with 
    Rithm's Javascript course material from sheer beginner, to intermediate, and likely on into
    experienced development items he might show along the way. The top-level URL for this 
    course can be found 
    <a href="https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/javascript/introduction-to-javascript-intro" target="_blank">
    here</a>.</p>

    <blockquote>

    <p>
    <a href="tut01-embeddedjslink.html" target="_blank">Tutorial 01: Embedded Javascript Link in HTML5</a><br>
    External JavaScript from a separate folder, linked into an HTML5 file. Simple stuff, but 
    I'm in the re-learning phase. Much has changed over the past several years for me. </p>

    <p>
    <a href="tut02-addnametovariables.html" target="_blank">Tutorial 02: Prompt, Variable Assign, Output</a><br>
    Prompt user for first and last names, assign each to associated variables, use 
    getElementById and innerHTML to perform output in an HTML page.</p>

    <p>
    <a href="tut03-ifelsepizza.html" target="_blank">Tutorial 03: If-Else Pizza</a><br>
    Demonstrates the use of if-else statements to change the way a program flows. Let's see 
    if the user appreciates the same food the program does...</p>

    <p>
    <a href="tut04-guessanumber.html" target="_blank">Tutorial 04: Guess a Secret Number Between 1 and 10</a><br>
    Demonstrates the use of a variety of flow control, adding support to the knowledge of what was 
    covered in the previous tutorial.</p>

    <p>
    <a href="tut05-ternaryTrueFalse.html" target="_blank">Tutorial 05: Using the ternary operator in JS</a><br>
    Demonstrates the use of JavaScript's 'ternary operator' to test whether something is true 
    or false, executing the first item if true and the last item if false. This is an alternative 
    to an if-else statement.</p>

    <p>
    <a href="tut06-usingformsforinput.html" target="_blank">Tutorial 06: Using Forms for Input</a><br>
    This (as with a few other items in the first five entries I've made in this collection) was 
    thrown in by myself, for myself, but with the idea of sharing it with others as well. I 
    desired to start using HTML input forms rather than prompt() popups from here on out for 
    my interactive leanings. Since we're on a mission to do web development, I figure all the 
    learning done with Rithm's tutorials should be integrated into web pages rather than in 
    the browser console (though, it IS great for debugging and trying one-off items). </p>

    <p>
    <a href="tut07-switchstatements.html" target="_blank">Tutorial 07: Using the 'switch' Statement</a><br>
    Using 'switch' statements rather than if-else. Though not used as often as the other 
    flow control statements, switch can find a place in the greater scheme of things.</p>

    <p>
    <a href="tut08-modulusoperator.html" target="_blank">Tutorial 08: Using the Modulus Operator</a><br>
    The modulus operator exists in many programming languages, characterised by the '%' character. 
    The modulus operator is great for checking to see if the result of division results in a
    remainder. That remainder itself can be used for calculations, or the whole number can as well. 
    Modulus can also be used for decision-making based on whether or not the original number is 
    odd or even, or divisible by any other number.</p>

    <p>
    <a href="tut09-arrays.html" target="_blank">Tutorial 09: Array Goodies</a><br>
    This page has built-in functionality to perform like an array playground. We can change 
    elements, push elements, pop elements, all while watching the array being changed with 
    our modifications. Having a look at the JavaScript source file can provide more in-depth 
    insight in how it all works.</p>

    <p>
    <a href="tut10-arrays2-splice.html" target="_blank">Tutorial 10: Arrays2 - Using Splice</a>
    In the last example, we used push(), pop(), unshift() and shift() to modify arrays. But 
    now we will take a venture into the use of the splice() function to do similar things. 
    Much more versatile and powerful than the aforementioned tools, though everything has its 
    place.</p>

    <p>
    <a href="tut11-arrays3-length-slice.html" target="_blank">Tutorial 11: Arrays3 - Length and Slice</a>
    Play with length and slice in working with arrays.</p>

    <p>
    <a href="tut12-forloops.html" target="_blank">Tutorial 12: For Loops - Iterating, incrementing, 
    and decrementing</a><br>
    Here we have a look at how to use a 'for' loop to count through a series of numbers or 
    array elements, doing something with each one as it moves forward. A for loop begins with 
    a condition that is true, and continues until the condition becomes false, at which time 
    the loop then ends, sending program flow control to the next instruction or block after it. </p>

    <p>
    <a href="tut13-forloops-iterateArrayLength.html" target="_blank">Tutorial 13: For Loops & Array Length</a>
    <br>
    We are iterating through a pre-populated array built into the JavaScript program for this 
    page. It consists of a list of my favorite food types. The goal here is to understand how 
    to marry for loops with the 'length' method to use in our 'for' loop counter to get the 
    job done when we don't know how many elements there are in the array at a given moment. </p>

    <p>
    <a href="tut14-whileloops.html" target="_blank">Tutorial 14: Using 'while' Loops in JavaScript</a><br>
    Example in how to implement a 'while loop' to do something. A while loop can be handy when 
    checking to make sure something was entered in a form correctly. It can also be used similar 
    to a 'for loop', incrementing or decrementing as needed. </p>

    <p>
    <a href="tut15-mathround-do-while.html">Tutorial 15: Math.round and do-while Iterating an Array</a><br>
    A do-while loop is similar to a 'while' loop with the one exception being that it is guaranteed 
    to cycle through a chunk of code at least one time before checking to see if a condition is 
    true or false.  Here in this exercise, JavaScript will be used to perform a rounding operation 
    on some numbers in an array, outputting them to an HTML page when it is finished processing. </p>

    <p>
    <a href="array-exercises/arrayExercises01-11.html">Array Exercises 1 - 11:</a><br>
    Here, I delve into the exercises given by Rithm School to help in cementing what I've   
    learned thus far.</p>

    <p>
    <a href="tut16-javascriptObjects.html" target="_blank">Tutorial 16: JavaScript Objects - 
    Creating objects, adding to, deleting</a></br>
    Practicing the creation of objects in JavaScript, adding to them, and deleting from them. 
    Remember, every key in a JavaScript object is a STRING. Sometimes you must use bracket 
    notation rather than dot notation. Practice makes perfect.</p>

    <p>
    <a href="function-exercises/functionExercises01.html" target="_blank">Function Exercise 1:</a><br>
    The first page of the functions intro was quite small. At the bottom is a series of about 
    eight actual exercises that I can put into webpage format here. In this first one, we 
    simply want to create a function that has my full name inside of an interior variable, and 
    to then output it with console.log. But here I will output to the bottom of an HTML page 
    instead, since my journey in learning is being kept as a log in which I (and others I share 
    with) can refer back to as many times as desired.</p>

    <p>
    <a href="function-exercises/functionExercises02.html" target="_blank">Function Exercise 2:</a><br>
    Use a function to randomly pick a tasty food item from a food array and output it to 
    the HTML page used for this exercise. </p>

    <p>
    <a href="function-exercises/functionExercises03.html" target="_blank">Function Exercise 3:</a><br>
    Use a function to iterate through a set of numbers in an array, outputting only the odd 
    numbers to the output area of the HTML page.</p>

    <p>
    <a href="function-exercises/functionExercises04.html" target="_blank">Function Exercise 4:</a><br>
    Use a function to iterate through a set of numbers in an array, outputting only the even 
    numbers to the output area of the HTML page. This exercise is similar to the previous one, 
    except there will be a slight modification in the 'if' statement where the numbers are 
    checked for being divisible by two.</p>

    <p>
    <a href="function-exercises/functionExercises05.html" target="_blank">Function Exercise 5:</a><br>
    Use a function called 'returnFirstEvenNumber' which iterates over the 'numbers' array and
    returns the first even number it finds (hint: use 'break' to exit at the very first even 
    number, getting out of the loop).</p>

    <p>
    <a href="function-exercises/functionExercises06.html" target="_blank">Function Exercise 6:</a><br>
    Use a function called 'returnFirstHalf' to get and return the first half of the numbers 
    found in a 'numbers' array.</p>

    <p>
    <a href="function-exercises/functionExercises07.html" target="_blank">Function Exercise 7:</a><br>
    Use a function called 'returnSecondHalf' to get and return the second half of the numbers
    found in a 'numbers' array.</p>
