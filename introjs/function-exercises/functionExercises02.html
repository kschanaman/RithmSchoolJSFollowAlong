        <h1>Functions Exercise 2: Random Math for Random Bites - In a 'functional' Way!</h1>

        <p>In this second exercise on the first tutorial page on functions, we will create 
        an array containing some foods. The exercise requirement is to place 'pizza' and 
        'ice cream' in that array, but man shall not live on pizza and ice cream alone. I will 
        add a few of my favorites along with them. We gotta have variety!!</p>

        <p>A function named randomFood will then be called upon to serve up a random 
        morsel of goodness each time the HTML page is refreshed. Just do me one favor: 
        Don't talk with your mouth full. It's rude.</p>

        <p>You can view the <a href="js/functionExercise02.js" target="_blank">actual 
        JavaScript code</a> that sends the food items to the output section of the page below. 
        In it, there are comments describing what I did to make things work as they do here.</p>

        <p>OUTPUT:</p>
