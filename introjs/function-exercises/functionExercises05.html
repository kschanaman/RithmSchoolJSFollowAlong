        <h1>Function Exercise 5: Iterate Until First Even Number</h1>

        <p>In this fifth exercise, we do similar to what we did in the previous exercise 
        where we returned only even numbers found in the 'numbers' array. Here, we will 
        exit the loop once we've come across the very first even number using 'break' to 
        jump out of it. Be sure to <a href="js/functionExercise05.js" target="_blank">check 
        out the JavaScript file</a> to review what was done to produce the output below, and 
        to read the comments embedded in it which explain things more clearly.</p>

        <p>There is no user interation in this exercise, but the output below was indeed 
        produced by the JavaScript source code file nonetheless. </p>
