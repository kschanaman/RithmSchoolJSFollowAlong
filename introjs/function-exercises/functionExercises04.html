        <h1>Functions Exercise 4: Display Even Numbers in an Array</h1>

        <p>This exercise is the same as the previous, only this time we will be having a 
        JavaScript program display only the EVEN numbers at the bottom of the page rather than
        the odd ones.  As with the previous exercise, I've chosen to not spend any time 
        making it user interactive. Keeping things simple here, as the key is to be learning 
        about functions and how they work.</p>

        <p>Be sure to have a look at the <a href="js/functionExercise04.js" target="_blank">
        actual JavaScript code</a> to see how this exercise works.  As always, I like to 
        profusely comment things here in the learning phase for my own benefit as I look back 
        to these things in the future, and for the benefit of anyone else I'm sharing these 
        things with while they are learning as well.</p>
