        <h1>Function Exercise 07: Return Second Half</h1>

        <p>This is the last of the seven exercises before the next Rithm School section, 
        where we delve deeper into using functions. Here, we do just as we did in the previous 
        exercises, only we slice and display the second half of the numbers in the 'numbers' 
        function.</p>

        <p>There is no user interactivity on this page, but the output found below was indeed 
        generated by <a href="js/functionExercise07.js" target="_blank">the actual 
        JavaScript code</a> for this exercise. Be sure to have a peek at it to see how it 
        works, and to learn a bit from the comments included within it.</p>
