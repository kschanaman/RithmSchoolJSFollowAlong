        <h1>Functions Exercise 3: Display Odd Numbers - In a Functional Way</h1>

        <p>The third exercise given by Rithm School, at the end of the first page on intro to 
        functions, requires a variable called numbers, which is an array containing the numbers 
        1 through 10. A function named 'displayOddNumbers' iterates over those numbers and 
        displays only the odd ones.</p>

        <p>Again, I haven't included user interactivity for this exercise, as the basics are 
        what we are after. Thus, the page will load and run 
        <a href="js/functionExercise03.js" target="_blank"> the JavaScript code for this 
        exercise</a> outputting the results at the bottom of the HTML page once it's loaded.</p>

        <p>OUTPUT:</p>
