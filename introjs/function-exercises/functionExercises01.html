    <h1>Functions: Create and Call a Function, Output to HTML Page</h1>

    <p>The first page of Rithm School's functions introduction is rather short, but still 
    to the point. At the end of it, they already have eight cut-and-dried exercises to do 
    with functions. </p>

    <p>For this first exercise, one is asked to create a function called myName that logs the 
    student's full name as output using console.log. However, since I've chosen to do all 
    exercises as static files to refer to in the future, and to share, I am going to be sending
    all output to the bottom of this page as I have been doing with all other intro materials.</p>

    <p>There are no user interactive forms for this exercise, so the output of the 
    <a href="js/functionExercise01.js" target="_blank">JavaScript code file</a> used in this 
    exercise will appear below once all DOM content has loaded (this will feel instantaneous
    appearing immediately actually). Click the link in this paragraph to view the actual 
    JavaScript code and all comments I've placed within it. </p>

    <p>OUTPUT:</p>
