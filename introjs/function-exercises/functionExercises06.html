        <h1>Function Exercise 06: Return First Half</h1>

        <p>In this sixth exercise, we will hava JavaScript grab only the first half of all the 
        numbers in a 'numbers' array.  That array looks like this:</p>

        <p>numbers[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]</p>

        <p>The script will slice the first half, assign the numbers to a second intermediate 
        array, and then output it below in green 'phosphor' text for that old nostalgic 
        computer monitor experience (well ok, we've been doing this all along anyway haha!</p>

        <p>No user interaction is included in this page, but the output below is indeed from 
        the JavaScript file nonetheless. Be sure to <a href="js/functionExercise06.js" target="_blank">
        check out the actual JavaScript file</a> to see the code and the comments included 
        therein.</p>
