        <h1>Using the Ternary Operator to Compare Two Numbers (as an example)</h1>

        <p>Compared to the last couple of exercises in which we played around with if-else 
        conditional statements, we can also use a ternary operator in JavaScript to make a 
        comparison between two items. It operates as such:</p>

        <p>something (true or false) ? (true, so do this) : (false, so do this instead);</p>

        <p>In this example, the user enters two numbers. They are compared with such a 
        ternary operator. If true, the first statement after the question mark is performed. 
        If false, the one after the colon is performed. </p>

        <p>Be sure to have a look at <a href="js/tut05-ternaryTrueFalse.js" target="_blank">
        the actual JavaScript file</a> in the 'js' directory to see the comments I placed within 
        it for further explanation of the following code. The code for this little exercise 
        looks as follows:</p>

<pre>

window.onload = function main() {

    var firstNum = parseInt(prompt("Please enter the first number to compare (firstNum): "));
    var secondNum = parseInt(prompt("Please enter the second number to compare (secondNum): "));
    
    alert("Checking to see if " + firstNum + " is less than " + secondNum + "...");

    pId = document.getElementById("p1");

    firstNum &lt; secondNum ? 
        pId.innerHTML = "firstNum, " + firstNum + ", is less than secondNum, " + secondNum :
        pId.innerHTML = "firstNum, " + firstNum + ", is greater than secondNum, " + secondNum;

}

</pre>

        <p>The output for the user in this case shall now be displayed below:</p>

        <p id="p1"></p>

        </div>

    </body>
