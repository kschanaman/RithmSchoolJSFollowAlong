        <h1>Guess a Number Between 1 and 10</h1>

        <p>This little program asks the user to guess the secret number which is between 1 
        and 10. A variable named 'numTries' will be established and set to 1 try. This is 
        because in this program, it is impossible to not try at least one guess. But if that 
        first guess is incorrect, the program enters a while loop. Each time a guess is 
        done and it's incorrect, the variable numTries will be incremented by one. Then, 
        depending on whether or not number of guesses was three or less, or more than three, 
        an appropriate response will be printed to the browser screen at the bottom.</p>

        <p>Be sure to have a look at <a href="js/tut04-guessanumber.js" target="_blank">
        the actual JavaScript file in the 'js' directory</a> to see the comments I placed 
        within it for further explanation of the following code. The code for this little 
        exercise looks as follows:</p>

<pre>

window.onload = function main() {

var secretNumber = 8;
var guess = 0;
var pId = null;
var numTries = 1;

guess = parseInt(prompt("Please guess the secret number (hint: it is between 1 and 10: "));
            
    while (guess !== secretNumber) {
        guess = parseInt(prompt("Incorrect! Please try again: "));
        numTries++;
    }
    
    pId = document.getElementById("p1");
        
    if (numTries > 1 && numTries <= 3) {
        pId.innerHTML = "Contrats! You guessed it in three tries or less!! The secret number " + 
            "was indeed " + secretNumber + "! Good Job!!&lt;br&gt;";
    } else {     
        pId.innerHTML = "Congrats! You guessed the secret number! It is indeed " + secretNumber + "!" + 
            " But it took you " + numTries + " tries to figure it out. Better luck next time!&lt;br&gt;";    
    }
}
</pre>

        <p>And now here is the congratulation message once the user has guessed correctly: </p>

        <p id="p1"></p>
    </div>
