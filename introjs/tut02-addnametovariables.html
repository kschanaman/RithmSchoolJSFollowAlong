    <h1>Prompt, Assign to Variables, Output to innerHTML</h1>

    <p>
    This script prompts the user for first and last names, assigns them to variables, then 
    uses getElementById to grab a paragraph with the id of 'id01'.  The message is put 
    together and then displayed within that tagged paragraph.</p>

    <p>Be sure to have a look at the <a href="js/tut02-addnametovariables.js" target="_blank">
    actual JavaScript file</a> in the 'js' directory 
    to see the comments I placed within it for further explanation of the following code. 
    The code for this little exercise looks as follows:</p>

    <pre>
        var firstName, lastName;
        firstName = prompt("What is your first name, friend?");
        lastName = prompt("What is your last name, friend?");
        
        var pId = document.getElementById=("p1");
        pId.innerHTML = "Hello, " + firstName + " " + lastName + ", it's very nice to meet you!&lt;br&gt;");
    </pre>

    <p>And now here is the output from our script:</p>

    <p id="p1"></p>

    </body>
