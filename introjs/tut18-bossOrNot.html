        <h1>Tutorial 18: Boss? Or Not?</h1>

        <p>This little exercise is the second one on Rithm School's free introduction to 
        JavaScript, under the "Functions and Parameters" section of the short course. The 
        exercise asks the student to write a function named 'sayHello' which takes in a 
        string as a parameter. Built into the 
        <a href="js/tut18-bossOrNot.js" target="_blank">JavaScript code for this exercise </a>
        is a variable called "bossName" where the name of the boss (the student) is stored. 
        The function should have a special greeting if that is the name that is passed. 
        Otherwise, it should simply say hello to anyone else, including their name. </p>

        <form name="getTheName" id="getTheName" method="post" action="">
            
            <p>
            <label for="userName">Please enter your first name: </label>
            <input name="userName" id="userName" type="text">
            
            <button type="button" onclick="main();">Submit</button>
            </p>

        </form>
