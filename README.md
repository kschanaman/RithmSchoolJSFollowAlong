INTRODUCTION

This repository is fully a part of my own personal journey. Heck, even using Github is 
part of that journey as well. Thus, this is also my first project commit here. 

I have grown tired of all the framework abstractions. I've seen it many times online 
where folks are getting barraged with angry criticisms for mentioning that frameworks 
are actually 'breeding sloppy coders'.  The angry comeback always seems to be:  
"If you never learned to code well enough that you could write your OWN framework, then 
you don't really know how to code." 

Setting aside the angry tone they tend to use, I personally feel my own coding has 
suffered from trying to learn the frameworks rather than the languages the frameworks 
were built upon in the first place.  And so, I've decided to refresh my memory in 
actual JavaScript. After all, why not? I'm going to learn JavaScript ES6 anyway. May 
as well do a refresher.

ABOUT THIS REPOSITORY

I decided to go through a nice little freely-available course online put forth by 
Rithm School.  The school provides several levels of JavaScript training freely. From 
introductory fundamentals through some advanced topics. This repository holds the 
exercises I crafted on my own while going through Rithm's coursework. 

HTML vs CONSOLE

I'm one who likes to have things I can look back on at times if I forgot something.  
When playing around with things in the browser console, it's all fun and games until 
the browser is closed. Then, *poof*, everything goes to 'bit heaven'.  Not to mention, 
if one wants to put things to use in HTML pages anyway, allowing one to be creative, 
the console isn't really much fun at all.  Useful for one-off experimentation, yes.  
But otherwise, no.

I also felt it would be a nice gesture to share my learning experiments with others 
who may enjoy looking at the relationships between JavaScript and HTML pages How it 
is all pulled together. How it gets interacted with by the user/visitor. Separation 
of logic/model (the programs) and the view (the front-end HTML pages). 

SUMMARY

This repo contains everything beginners (and experienced who desire a refresher) need 
in addition to Rithm School's JavaScript line of public coursework. Follow along with 
their course and make the entries in the browser console as they instruct, trying out 
some of your own changes.  Then, look into the exercises I build along with that 
browser console work in this repo to improve your skills even further. 

I tend to use very basic HTML forms and submission button procedures in the examples. 
No security, injection attack prevention, etc., is included since these are meant only 
for the concept of learning the JavaScript fundamentals in a fun way, able to be run 
from a person's local computer and web browser.  None of it is meant to be hosted on 
an actual live production web server. As long as this is remembered, the methods I've 
used in the HTML part of things is perfectly safe otherwise. 

Please enjoy your time with these materials.

Regards!
