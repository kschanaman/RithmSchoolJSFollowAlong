    <p>
    Here in the Rithm School folder of the 'learn' directory, I will be following along with 
    Rithm's Javascript course material from sheer beginner, to intermediate, and likely on into
    experienced development items he might show along the way. I will likely throw myself some 
    curve balls into the mix (and for those following along too) by incorporating a few 
    advanced things (look-ahead, if you will).</p>
    
    <p>While the course has the student enter code snippets into the browser's developer 
    tool 'console', I figured it might be more interesting to create mini HTML applications 
    using each thing covered. This requires some things like 'getElementById', creating 
    separate JavaScript files (in the js directory of this collection), and devising a simple 
    stylesheet to tidy things up nicely and to be easy on the eyes (in the css directory of 
    this collection).  For awhile, input will be via prompt(), notifications will be via 
    alert(), and output will be displayed using element id (such as &lt;p id="p1"&gt;)</p>

    <p>I will do the best I can in making things simple, as I will likely be sharing this 
    collection of projects online for others to benefit from, if possible.</p>

    The beginning things learned will go under this directory. Subsequent courses will go 
    into directories listed following this one on an as-needed basis. The top-level URL for
